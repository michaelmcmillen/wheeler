<h1>Wheeler</h1>

Wheeler is a personal ongoing project, which looks to provide an all encompassing service to create, distribute and sign up for rides, with the addition of waiting lists, email notifications and Strava & Komoot integration.

The idea for this project came as a result of lockdowns 'Rule of 6' for outdoor activities (UK). Arranging group rides relied on Facebook posts, comments and eventual Excel spreadsheet use. This application looks to streamline this process and provide a more efficient and simple way to manage group rides.

Once complete to its basic functionality, it is hoped this application will be used in the real world and continually improved.
