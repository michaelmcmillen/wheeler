<h1>Wheeler</h1>

Wheeler is a personal ongoing project, which looks to provide an all encompassing service to create, distribute and sign up for rides, with the addition of waiting lists, email notifications and Strava & Komoot integration.

The idea for this project came as a result of lockdowns 'Rule of 6' for outdoor activities (UK). Arranging group rides relied on Facebook posts, comments and eventual Excel spreadsheet use. This application looks to streamline this process and provide a more efficient and simple way to manage group rides.

Once complete to its basic functionality, it is hoped this application will be used in the real world and continually improved.

<h1>Future Plans</h1>

The purpose of the application is to cater for a specific cycle group, and that is how it is currently being designed and developed, only to be used by 1 cycle group. However once in use, the aim would be to develop this out to cater for as many people as possible, with the ability to create and split out users into their own groups i.e. new groups can be created and rides applicable to only specific groups, in addition to all other features such as waiting lists and notifications.
